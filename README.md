### This repo is going to contain the same project, a note taking and storing application, but written using different languages and different frameworks. 

Initial goal is to have: 
- C# version, most likely with a simple console interface with an Asp.net Core backend
- Kotlin version using TornadoFX for the frontend and a graphql-kotlin + Spring Boot backend
- Android Compose version
- FaunaDb version (language undecided)
